                            Yes — that’s part of its charm. No cars, sandy streets, golf carts and bikes everywhere. After rain, some streets may flood. It’s relaxed, simple, and slow-paced — If you’re looking for a 5 star luxury retreat, this ain’t it

                            Yes. It’s a very friendly, walkable island with a strong local community. You’ll notice even the night life shuts down pretty early (before 11pm most nights)

                            *Most* places will accept credit cards but don’t rely on it. There are ATMs on the island but they don’t always work and charge higher fees.

                            Yes — plenty. The retreat is intentionally designed with a balance of movement, adventure, and downtime. Everything on the schedule is optional, though I recommend stepping out of your comfort zone once in a while ;)
