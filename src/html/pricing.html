                        <span>Why Holbox?</span>
                        <span class="faq-icon">+</span>
                    </button>
                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>I chose Holbox because it's one of those rare places that feels alive with energy but calm at the same time. I've travelled here multiple times, and every time I return, I feel the same thing — that indescribable mix of peace, joy, and perspective that comes from slowing down and reconnecting with yourself.</p>
                        
                        <p>Holbox has a magic that's hard to put into words. It has a natural wellness to it — not because it's curated or luxurious, but because of how effortlessly it makes you unplug. You'll find locals biking barefoot through sandy streets, open-air restaurants serving fresh seafood, and sunsets that stop you in your tracks. There's music, laughter, amazing food, and just the right amount of nightlife if you want it — but there's also quiet, hammocks, and time to breathe.</p>
                        
                        <p>What I love most is that Holbox is not a luxury all-inclusive destination — and that's exactly why it's perfect for Soul Strong. There are no cars here, only golf carts, ATVs and bikes. Some streets flood after the rain, and you might see a bit of seaweed along the shore. But that's all part of the island's charm. It's a community that values sustainability, simplicity, and connection to nature.</p>
                        
                        <p>Between the turquoise waters of the Yucatán Sea, the vibrant murals, the flamingos, and the warm local energy — Holbox is the kind of place that grounds you and inspires you at the same time. It's the perfect backdrop for this retreat: movement, mindfulness, connection, and that healthy balance between challenge and chill.</p>
