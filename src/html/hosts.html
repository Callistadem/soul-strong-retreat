                            <h3>Adelade LaFontaine</h3>
                            <p class="host-title">Certified Personal Trainer and Behavior Change Specialist <br> Founder of AGM Health & Fitness and creator of the Strength Starts Here program</p>
                            
                            <p class="host-bio"> Adelade is a Certified Personal Trainer and Behaviour Change Specialist who helps people rediscover their strength — physically, mentally, and emotionally. Known for her no-pressure, real-life approach, she combines functional strength training with mindset and behaviour change to make fitness feel simple, empowering, and sustainable.  <br><br>
                            After years of coaching clients who felt anxious or overwhelmed by traditional gym culture, Adelade created Strength Starts Here, an online step-by-step program that teaches people how to build confidence and consistency in the gym without burnout or perfectionism. Her philosophy is simple: movement should enhance your life, not take it over.  <br><br>
                            The Soul Strong Retreat was born from that same belief — that strength and rest can coexist. Expect a healthy dose of workouts and adventure balanced with beach time, local food, laughter, and space to just be. <br><br>
                            When she’s not coaching, Adelade can be found hanging out with her husband and their dog-child Bobby, planning her next adventure with her girlfriends (at this age, coordinating schedules can take months!), searching for the best sandwiches in Montreal, or watching reality TV with a glass of wine. She believes fitness should support the good stuff in life — not replace it.
