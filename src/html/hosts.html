                                Adelade is a Certified Personal Trainer and Behaviour Change Specialist who helps people rediscover their strength — physically, mentally, and emotionally. Known for her no-pressure, real-life approach, she combines functional strength training with mindset and behaviour change to make fitness feel simple, empowering, and sustainable.
                                <br><br>
                                After years of coaching clients who felt anxious or overwhelmed by traditional gym culture, Adelade created Strength Starts Here, an online step-by-step program that teaches people how to build confidence and consistency in the gym without burnout or perfectionism. Her philosophy is simple: movement should enhance your life, not take it over.
                                <br><br>
                                The Soul Strong Retreat was born from that same belief — that strength and rest can coexist. Expect a healthy dose of workouts and adventure balanced with beach time, local food, laughter, and space to just be.
                                <br><br>
                                When she's not coaching, Adelade can be found hanging out with her husband and their dog-child Bobby, planning her next adventure with her girlfriends (at this age, coordinating schedules can take months!), searching for the best sandwiches in Montreal, or watching reality TV with a glass of wine. She believes fitness should support the good stuff in life — not replace it.

                                We'll be teaming up with Sayde Tohme, founder and lead trainer of Holbox Bootcamp, a beach-based functional training experience on the stunning island of Holbox, Mexico. She combines CrossFit-inspired strength and cardio, bodyweight, and functional movement with a focus on well-being, mindfulness, and community. The sessions are fun, challenging, and uplifting, welcoming locals and travelers alike, leaving everyone feeling stronger, energized, and inspired.
                                <br><br>
                                We'll alternate between training with Holbox Bootcamp and using the space for our own classes, just steps away from the Yucatan Sea for a refreshing dip after your sweat session!

                                We'll be teaming up with Holly, founder of Holbox Yoga, for our retreat. Originally from London, Holly found her home in Holbox in 2019 and has since built one of the island's most welcoming yoga and wellness communities.
                                <br><br>
                                She offers group and private classes in hatha, vinyasa, power, yin, and mandala flow, along with meditation, sound healing, Reiki, and corrective exercise. Her mission is to keep Holbox Yoga a down-to-earth, inclusive space where everybody feels at home—whether you can't yet touch your toes or you're an arm-balancing pro. Awaken Joy, her studio motto, runs through everything she teaches.
                                <br><br>
                                For our retreat, Holly will lead the opening yoga + intention-setting session, a closing sound-healing ceremony, and optional yoga classes throughout the week for anyone who wants to complement their training with yoga.
