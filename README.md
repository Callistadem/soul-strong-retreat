### Overview
Soul Strong Fitness Retreat is a custom static website I designed and developed for a client hosting a fitness and wellness retreat in Holbox, Mexico. 
The goal was to create a clean, modern, and responsive site that reflects the brand’s serene, earthy aesthetic while clearly communicating event details and inclusions.

### Built With
`HTML` `CSS` `JavaScript`

I used core web technologies to keep the site lightweight, fast, and easy to maintain. Since it’s a simple, static site, a framework would have added unnecessary complexity and reduced performance.

### Highlights
- Fully responsive design across desktop and mobile
- Smooth scrolling and intuitive navigation
- Clear presentation of retreat details, accommodations, and pricing
- Subtle animations to enhance the user experience
- Designed to capture the retreat’s tone: calm, strong, and inspiring
